# freeauth-admin Directory

The `freeauth-admin` directory is an integration of the FreeAuth FastAPI extension and serves as the web application for the FreeAuth management dashboard.

You can develop you own functionalities on top of `freeauth-admin`. Alternatively, you can also use FreeAuth as a microservie after the OSS feature is supported in FreeAuth version 2.x.
