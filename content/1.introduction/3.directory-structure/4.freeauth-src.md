# src/freeauth Directory

The `src/freeauth` directory is organized into three main sections:

1. **conf**: The `conf` module includes various settings and parameters that define FreeAuth's behavior and operation.

2. **db**: The `db` module includes the EdgeDB data schema definition files and EdgeQL scripts for FreeAuth's functionality. Additionally, it contains synchronous and asynchronous interfaces generated using the `edgedb-python` codegen tool.

3. **security**: Within this module, you'll find security-related public methods.
