# dbschema Directory

The `dbschema` directory is located at the root of the project, it's a direcory that stores the EdgeDB model and schema definitions.

You can create your own data model files with the `.esdl` extension within this directory. These files are written using the EdgeDB's Schema Definition Language ([SDL](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/datamodel/index#schema)).


By default, during the project setup process. FreeAuth will automatically create its own data model definition files as hard links under the `dbschema` directory. Additionally, the filenames of the FreeAuth data model files are all prefixed with `freeauth_`.

Here is an example directory structure that illustrates the `dbschema` directory:

```
dbschema/
│
├─ migrations/
│  └─ 00001.edgeql
│  └─ ...
│
├─ default.esdl
├─ freeauth_auth.esdl
└─ ...
```

Once you've made your definitions within the `dbschema` directory, you can use `make db` or `edgedb migration create` to create a migration file.

Please note that avoid modifying FreeAuth's data model definition files.
