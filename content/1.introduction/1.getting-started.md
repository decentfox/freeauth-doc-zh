## Create a new project

### FastAPI REST API Server

1. Clone the backend repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:decentfox/freeauth-api.git
cd freeauth-api
```

2. Install the dependencies, prep environment and initial project:

```bash
make setup
```

During the first installation, you will enter an interactive session to initialize the EdgeDB project:

```console
Specify the name of EdgeDB instance to use with this project [default: FreeAuth]: 
> FreeAuth
```

::alert{type="info"}
In the final step of the installation, an administrator account will be automatically generated for you. Please do remember the **login username** and **initial password**, as they will be used to access the admin website for further configuration.
::

3. Run the `dev` command to start FreeAuth server in development mode:

```bash
make dev
```

::alert{type="success"}
