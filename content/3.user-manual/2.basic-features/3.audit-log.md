# Audit Log

FreeAuth offers a simple and basic Audit Log that can be accessed through the item `审计日志` in the left sidebar menu. The central table on this page displays all log data, including event types, user information, IP, etc. So far, the event type `事件类型` only covers `注册` , `登录` , `登出` , and `修改密码` , which will be continued to extend when necessary. In a word, this table provides information on who, when, and where an event occurred, as well as its outcome. Additionally, this table also supports filtering, searching, and sorting data. Although we have not yet released the export data feature, it is currently on our product backlog.
