From the structure of the sidebar menu, you can see three different groups of features: Basic Features, Advanced Features, and Ecosystem Related Features.

Let's get started with the basic features of FreeAuth.

# Customization

The first feature is designed to personalize the login and registration frames to your desired style. The entrance of this feature is located as the first item named `定制登录` in the left sidebar. Click on it, and you will be directed to the following interface:

On this page, you can customize your logo, title, primary color, and the link to your login and registration protocol if you have one. Additionally, you can also adjust the layout and other configurations by toggling the left panel to `注册配置` and `登录配置`. The great thing about this feature is that any changes you make on the left panel will be immediately reflected in the right demo view.

    2. an email with the verification code.

Once the setup above is complete, users will see your customized login and registration box when they try to sign in or sign up. For example, we have added a blue logo, set the title to `FreeAuth`, chosen dark gray as the primary color, and selected the registration method of a mobile phone number plus the verification code, etc. As a result, users will see interfaces similar to the following when they attempt to log in or register for your system:
