# Login FreeAuth

Hello there!

You have already set up everything and successfully made FreeAuth run on your side by following the Readme. You must have noticed that an administrator account is automatically generated after you run the command: `make setup`.

To get started, let's open the FreeAuth admin site in your browser. You can use the account details provided above to sign in as the first user and administrator. When logging in, don't forget to switch the login method to username-and-password mode and enter the username and password you received during the system setup process.

Then, click on the button `登录` and you will be directed to the interface indicating that you have the authorization to sign in. However, before proceeding further, the system will prompt you to reset your password to replace the initial random one generated by the system.

After setting your own password, you will enter the system's home page and be allowed to use all the features we released in V1.0 because of the privileges of your account.

Here, we suggest you go to the profile page to supplement your information first so that you can also use your email or phone number with the verification code to log in to the system in the future, which is safer and less challenging for your memory. 

The entrance of the profile page is on the right corner of the top menu bar. Click the most right icon, and you will see a dropdown menu expand, including `个人信息`, which is the entrance to the profile page.

In addition to your mobile phone number and email, we suggest you also change your username to the one you are familiar with in case it's a bit hard for you to remember the random username assigned by the system.

Let's keep staying on the profile page and switch the tab from the first tab `基本信息` to the third tab `角色信息`. You will see that you are assigned the role named `系统管理员`, which means you are this system's administrator and have all permissions in this system.

As for the tab `组织归属`, you can come back to figure out what it is for after you initialize an organizational structure for the system if needed.
