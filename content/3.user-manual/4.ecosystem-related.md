As you can see, there is an item in the sidebar menu for application management in this section, but it hasn't been ready yet. Once it's prepared, you can maintain multiple applications in FreeAuth and use FreeAuth as an identity verification service to support various systems to share common user data.

Furthermore, we will constantly work on providing more features surrounding the whole ecosystem to cater to more practical scenarios. We have many exciting features, including single sign-on, data export/import, etc., on our product backlog. We sincerely welcome your help in making them a reality. Join us in improving FreeAuth for all developers and users.
