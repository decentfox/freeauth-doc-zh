# Using FreeAuthApp Extension

The `FreeAuthApp` object that will wire the db client and the authentication dependencies. You can initial your `FreeAuthApp` instance by passing an FastAPI application instance like this:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from freeauth.ext.fastapi_ext import FreeAuthApp

auth_app = FreeAuthApp()

def get_app():
  app = FastAPI()
  auth_app.init_app(app)

asgi_app = get_app()
```
