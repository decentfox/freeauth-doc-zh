# Documentation of [FreeAuth](https://github.com/decentfox/freeauth-api) in Chineses.

We are using [Docus](https://docus.dev) to write our documentation.

## Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

Start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Edge Side Rendering

Can be deployed to Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions, AWS, and most Node-compatible environments.

Look at all the available presets [here](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment#presets).

```bash
yarn build

## Static Generation

Use the `generate` command to build your application.

The HTML files will be generated in the .output/public directory and ready to be deployed to any static compatible hosting.

```bash
yarn generate
```

## Preview build

You might want to preview the result of your build locally, to do so, run the following command:

```bash
yarn preview
```
